# Reinforcement-DQN
Introduction to Machine Learning - Project 4


The task of this project is to implement reinforcement learning based on Deep Q-network in order to be able
to play the Phoenix Atari game ,where the agent's task is to shoot the enemies in the sky within reasonable
time in the fully observable grid-environment and successfully defeat the space invaders. Also, the Q network
plays the Lunar lander game, where the agent (spacecraft) successfully lands on the landing pad. Fuel is
infnite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.
